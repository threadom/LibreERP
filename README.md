# LibreERP - Open Source Entreprise Ressource Planning
###### build in PHP with Laravel and MariaDB, using TailWindCSS and TypeScript

App will be oriented to micro async request using api routes.
This must be modular without necessity of change any file of core.

Sorry for everyone but a large part of directories, files, variables, and functions will be probably french named.\
But everyone who will be working on the project will keep in mind the possibility of a renaming script.
